This project is on my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly Greece thesis called "A Movie Recommendation Engine Based on Deep Learning Algorithms".
You can find the dataset used here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/.
The project includes an in depth EDA on the data and then an LSTM based sequential recommender system architecture based on Pytorch-Lightning framework.
